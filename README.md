# uk-code-service

This is one of the main component in postcoder where all the business logic resides for Premise address lookup for the URL https://developers.alliescomputing.com/postcoder-web-api/address-lookup/premise.
Uk-code-service is based on nodejs which runs on a separate docker container and it uses hapijs for server. It fetches address details from third-party API's and caches it in the redis server. When second query gets, it does not take it from API's instead retrieves it from the redis cache.
